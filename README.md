# Git Profile Manager
A Profile and folder Manager for git accounts


This works by having ssh keys in the .ssh folder rather than using a git profile. 

It lets you have multiple git accounts on the same computer, and most importantly to me, manage git accounts on a folder by folder basis.

I made this for me, because I wanted to. Maybe other people will like it, maybe they won't, but I like it. 

I'm still working on getting all the bugs out though...
